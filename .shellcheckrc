# ShellCheck configuration for wt-worktree-manager
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# The script is zsh, not bash
shell=bash

# Disable specific warnings that don't apply to zsh or are intentional

# SC2034: Variable appears unused - many are used in child processes/hooks
disable=SC2034

# SC2154: Variable referenced but not assigned - zsh handles this differently
disable=SC2154

# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing - zsh handles this better
disable=SC2086

# SC2128: Expanding array without index - zsh behaves differently
disable=SC2128

# SC2206: Quote to prevent word splitting - zsh arrays work differently
disable=SC2206

# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes - this is intentional
disable=SC2016

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source - we source config files dynamically
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced file - same reason
disable=SC1091

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately - common zsh pattern, less risky than in bash
disable=SC2155

# External sources - mark files that are sourced
external-sources=true
